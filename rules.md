# GoLocke Rules

## Important rule
While there's no need to stictly follow this ruleset, list the rules you plan to use before beginning your GoLocke. Don't force people to make assumptions on your ruleset! If you must, you may remove (not add or re-implement) rules at a later point.

## Rules inherited from the standard Nuzlocke
These rules are based on the standard Nuzlocke challenge.
- If a Pok√©mon faints, it must be released or put in a box and never used again with that save.
- Only your first Pok√©mon per route may be obtained (though our method of obtaining them is different, stay tuned)
- (optional) All Pok√©mon must be nicknamed.
- (optional) Your starter is the only fixed encounter you may obtain
- (optional) No healing items in battle, or (optional) no healing items at all

## Rules new to this variation
These rules are GoLocke-specific
- All obtained Pok√©mon must be swapped with an eligible Pok√©mon from Pok√©mon Go (more on that later) as early as possible
- (optional) you may choose not to swap your starter
- (guideline) do your best not to use Pok√©mon that haven't been swapped yet (may be impossible in some cases)

## Pok√©mon Eligibility
- Keep eligible Pok√©mon tagged in Pok√©mon Go in order to search for them later
  - Only one tag should be necessary per challenge. use search filters to work with contextual rules (such as no legendaries)
- When swapping a Pok√©mon out, use a random number generator to select which eligible Pok√©mon to swap in from a search
- Pok√©mon that cannot be transferred to the desired game (via limited Pok√©dex, being Shadow Pok√©mon, etc.) aren't eligible
- Pok√©mon must be low enough level to obey you in the main game to be eligible 
  - example: No Lv. 40 Pok√©mon may be used if only Pok√©mon up to level 10 will obey if received from a trade
- Legendary Pok√©mon may only be swapped in for other legendary Pok√©mon.
  - (optional) "legendary" may loosely refer to legendary and mythical Pok√©mon
  - (optional) no legendary/mythical Pok√©mon may be swapped in
- (optional) Pok√©mon evolutionary families that have already been swapped in are inelgible
