# GoLocke Rules

## Important rule
While there's no need to stictly follow this ruleset, list the rules you plan to use before beginning your GoLocke. Don't force people to make assumptions on your ruleset! If you must, you may remove (not add or re-implement) restrictions at a later point.

## Rules inherited from the standard Nuzlocke
These rules are based on the standard Nuzlocke challenge.
- If a Pok√©mon faints, it must be released or put in a box and never used again with that save.
- Use of Revives is not allowed during the Nuzlocke/GoLocke Challenge.
- Only your first Pok√©mon per route may be obtained (though our method of obtaining them is different, stay tuned).
- (optional, recommended) Set Battle Style to "set" as soon as you can.
- (optional) All Pok√©mon must be nicknamed as soon as possible.
- (optional) Your starter is the only fixed encounter you may obtain.
- (optional) No healing items in battle, or (optional) no healing items at all.

## Rules from [u/Jazzmtazz's ruleset on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/h7rhth/sword_and_shield_nuzlocke_rules_solved/)
- Up to 17 Pok√©mon may be caught in the Wild Area under the following rules:
  - Each Pok√©mon must be from a different zone of the Wild Area.
  - One Pok√©mon may be caught before the first Gym Challenge.
  - Two more Pok√©mon may be caught after getting each badge.
- (optional, recommended) Level Cap rules:
  - The level of the next Gym Leader's highest-level Pok√©mon is the highest level your Pok√©mon can be until that Gym Challenge starts.
    - If a Pok√©mon hits that cap, box it until that Gym Challenge.
    - If the cap is accidentally gone over, box it until the after the Gym Leader battle is won.
    - Pok√©mon may go above the Level Cap during the challenge. üôÇ
  - Level Cap list:
    - Gym Challenges:
      - 1: 20
      - 2: 24
      - 3: 25
      - 4: 36
      - 5: 38

    - Challenger Tournament: 55
    - Champion Match: 65
- (optional) If you chose not to swap you starter out, you may choose to release it after swapping out your first capture.
## Rules new to this variation
These rules are GoLocke-specific
- All obtained Pok√©mon must be swapped with an eligible Pok√©mon from Pok√©mon Go (more on that later) as early as possible.
  - Before swapping a Pok√©mon in, you may level it up to (X - 1), where X = Level Cap. Use a Pok√©mon Go Level Calculator for accuracy. üôÇ
- (optional) you may choose not to swap your starter.
- (guideline) do your best not to use Pok√©mon that haven't been swapped yet (may be impossible in some cases).

## Pok√©mon Eligibility
- Keep eligible Pok√©mon tagged in Pok√©mon Go in order to search for them later.
  - Use search filters to work with contextual rules (such as no legendaries).
- When swapping a Pok√©mon out, use a random number generator to select which eligible Pok√©mon to swap in from a search.
- Pok√©mon that cannot be transferred to the desired game (via limited Pok√©dex, being Shadow Pok√©mon, etc.) aren't eligible.
- Pok√©mon must be under the current Level Cap to be eligible.
- (optional, recommended) Make your own rules for what Pok√©mon are eligible. Please be transparent about these. üòÅ
  - Example: For the playtest, I would set aside individual hours to catch many Pok√©mon with the Pok√©mon Go Plus.
- Legendary Pok√©mon may only be swapped in for other legendary Pok√©mon.
  - (optional) "legendary" may loosely refer to legendary and mythical Pok√©mon.
  - (optional) no legendary/mythical Pok√©mon may be swapped in.
- (optional) Pok√©mon evolutionary families that have already been swapped in are ineligible.
